# 🔍 Simple Information Retrieval System in Python

A lightweight file search engine built in Python that reads local `.txt` files, creates an inverted index with word frequency and position, and provides a user-friendly GUI for searching.

## 📚 Features

- 🗂 Processes local text files and builds an **inverted index**
- 🔢 Tracks **word frequency** and **location** in each document
- 🔍 Supports **keyword search** across indexed files
- 🖥️ Simple and intuitive **GUI built with PySimpleGUI**
- ⚙️ Built entirely with core Python and minimal dependencies
- 🧱 Modular structure – easy to read, understand, and extend

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Add `.txt` files to the input directory  
2. The app scans and indexes all files  
3. Use the GUI to search keywords  
4. View search results with document names and word positions

## 💡 Use Cases

- Local file search utility  
- Educational tool for learning about indexing and IR systems  
- Quick prototypes for search features in small-scale projects

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python  
- **PySimpleGUI** (for GUI)  
- Standard libraries (`os`, `json`)
